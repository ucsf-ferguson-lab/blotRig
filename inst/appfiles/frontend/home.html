    <h3 style="font-size: 1.3em; padding-left: 15px;">Follow the steps below to get started:</h3>

    <p>
    <ol>
      <li class="litem">Upload a comma separated values (CSV) spreadsheet.</li>
      <ul class="uitem">This spreadsheet should include separate columns for subject ID and experimental groups.</ul>
      <li class="litem">Enter the total number of lanes that are available on their particular western blot gel
        apparatus.</li>
      <ul class="uitem">The blotRig software will first run a quality check to confirm that each subject ID (unique
        sample or subject)
        is only
        found in one experimental group. If duplicates are found, a warning will be shown that specifies which subjects
        are repeated
        across groups. If no errors are found, a gel map will be generated that illustrates the western blot gel lanes
        into which each
        subject should be loaded.</ul>
      <li class="litem">Once the gel map has been generated, the user can then select to export this gel map to a new
        spreadsheet.
      </li>
      <ul class="uitem">This sheet is designed to clearly show which gel each sample is on, which lane on each gel a
        sample is found,
        what
        experimental group each sample belongs to, and importantly, a repetition of each of these values for three
        technical replicates.</ul>
      <li class="litem">User will also see columns for Target Protein and Loading Control.</li>
      <ul class="uitem">These are the cells where the user can then input their densitometry values upon completing
        their western blot
        runs.
        Once this spreadsheet is filled out, it is then ready to go for blotRig analysis.</ul>
    </ol>
