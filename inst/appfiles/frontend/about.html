    <h1>About BlotRig</h1>

    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 30px;">
      This user-friendly interface is designed to facilitate appropriate counterbalancing and technical replication for
      western blot experimental design.

    <p>
      Users upload a spreadsheet with their sample IDs and experimental groups assignments for each sample, and blotRig
      will do the rest!
    </p>

    <p>
      blotRig creates a map of your western blot gels that illustrates which lane each sample should be loaded into.
    </p>

    <p>
      The decision for each lane loading is based on two main principles:
    <ol>
      <li>each western blot gel should hold a representative sample of each experimental group</li>
      <li>samples from the same experimental group are not loaded in adjacent lanes whenever possible</li>
    </ol>
      This ensures that proper counterbalancing is achieved so that we can limit the chances that the inherent
      variability within and across western blot gels is confounded with the experimental groups that we are interested
      in experimentally testing.
