  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 30px;">
    This user-friendly interface is designed to facilitate appropriate counterbalancing and technical replication for 
    western blot experimental design.

    blotRig creates a map of your western blot gels that illustrates which lane each sample should be loaded into.  
    <br>
    <br>
    The decision for each lane loading is based on two main principles: 
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>1)</strong> each western blot gel should hold a representative sample of each experimental group 
      <br>
      <strong>2)</strong> samples from the same experimental group are not loaded in adjacent lanes whenever possible
      <br>
      <br>
        This ensures that proper counterbalancing is achieved so that we can limit the chances that the inherent variability within and across 
        western blot gels is confounded with the experimental groups that we are interested in experimentally testing.
